  Abstract: It is defying to know the level of corruption in the mining sector. One of the pertinent problem lies in the loading and dislodging of the HT (Haul trucks) at the mining spot. There are several occasions and sightings when unauthorized vehicles enter the mining area and steal valuable ores of materials or other precious elements, selling the raw materials in the grey market at desire able price. To prevent such precarious activities in the mining sector HT monitoring system is designed. HT monitoring system is designed to check the Haul trucks at the entrance and exit of the mines. The system would be such designed so as to allow only the authorized vehicles to enter the arena, and, only after verification can it exit from it. 
All the data of the HTs and the mined material would be uploaded to a government owned server as a written record for future use. Internet of things would play a major role in controlling the service of the application software. HT monitoring system will be useful in preventing corruption at the mining locations and would stop the drain of the countrys money.  
One of the bigger achievement of this project is to move a step closer towards digital India, wherein encapsulating digitalization in the mining sector. 
In the following presentation, a detailed description of the system is provided. </p>
